Fizzy Beats is a cross-browser compatible drum sequencer (tested in Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox) 
made with the Web Audio API and React. It's great for musicians who want to play around with a drum 
loop or even people who want to learn how to program drum beats for the first time. It has adjustable BPM, 
eight slots for storing drum patterns, and 4 different drum kits:
- **808**
- **Acoustic**
- **Electro**
- **Vinyl**

### What next?

I'd like to add more drum kits as well as the ability to export beats as .wav or .mp3 files. I'd also 
like to add some more functionality to the sequence buttons...like the ability to switch between note 
on/off to note repeat or note velocity. I started this project just as a way to learn React but 
I'd like the sequencer to be able to do things like the ones in DAWs like Ableton and Garageband.
